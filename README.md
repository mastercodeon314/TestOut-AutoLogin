# TestOut-AutoLogin

This is a tamper monkey script that will automatically log you into TestOut.

Upon running the script for the first time, you will be promoted to enter a random string for the encryption key. 
Next you will be prompted to enter your username and password for TestOut. 
Your credentials will be encrypted and saved in the script settings. 

Now anytime the TestOut login page is loaded in the browser, the script will execute and log you in eith your saved credentials. 
The script will also automatically click on the TestOut PC Pro link to continue that course. 

v1.1 Update:

Script will now detect when a course video is being played, and will move to the next section in the course once the video is done playing automatically!
